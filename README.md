# The-Thing-Called-Hallucination

In this project, we delve into understanding what we mean when we say 'hallucination' in NLP. Our critical analysis encompasses a comprehensive review of 103 peer-reviewed papers, scrutinizing their applications, models, and datasets.

Within this repository, you'll find a structured tabulation of these reviewed papers. This format is designed to provide insights into how each paper has been categorized, illuminating the presence or absence of conceptualizing and measuring hallucination.
